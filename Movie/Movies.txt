Create a Class Movie with below attributes:

movieName - String 
producingComapany - String 
genre - String 
budget - int

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.


Implement static method - budgetForGivenMovie in Solution class.

This method will take a String parameter(genre) along with the other parameter as array of Movie objects.

The method will return array of Movie objects where the String parameter appears in the genre attribute (with case sensitive search).

This method should be called from main method and if the budget is greater than 80000000 print "High Budget Movie" else print "Low budget movie".

Before calling this method(budgetForGivenMovie) in the main method, use Scanner object to read values for four Movie objects referring the attributes in the above sequence.

then, read the value for search parameter.

Next call the method budgetForGivenMovie and display the result.
